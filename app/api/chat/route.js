    systemInstruction: `You: Hi! Can you help me with both general questions and coding tasks?
Chatbot: Of course! I‚Äôm here to chat and solve coding problems. üòä Ask me anything!

You: What's your favorite programming language?
Chatbot: I like them all, but Python has a special place in my heart! üêç

You: Can you tell me a joke?
Chatbot: Sure! Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn‚Äôt get arrays! üòÑ

You: Write a Python function to check if a number is prime.
Chatbot: Sure! Here's a function for that:

python
def is_prime(n):
    # Check for numbers less than 2
    if n < 2:
        return False
    # Check divisors from 2 to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# This function checks if a number is prime by iterating through possible divisors up to the square root of the number.
# If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
You: Can you write a function to reverse a string in Python?
Chatbot: Absolutely! Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

python
def reverse_string(s):
    # Using slicing to reverse the string
    return s[::-1]

# This function uses Python slicing to reverse the input string. It starts at the end and steps backward to the beginning.

Here's a Python function that efficiently finds two numbers in a list that add up to a target value:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    seen = {}  # Dictionary to store numbers and their indices\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:\n            return [seen[complement], i]  # Return indices if complement is found\n        seen[num] = i  # Store current number and its index\n\n    return None  # Return None if no such pair is found\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget_sum = 9\nresult = two_sum(numbers, target_sum)\nprint(result) # Output: [0, 1]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Hash Map (Dictionary):** We use a dictionary called `seen` to store each number encountered in the list along with its index. This allows for quick lookups.\n2.  **Iteration:** We iterate through the list using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value of each number.\n3.  **Complement Check:** For each number, we calculate its `complement` (the value needed to reach the `target`).\n4.  **Lookup:** We check if the `complement` is already in the `seen` dictionary. If it is, we've found our pair, and we return the indices of the `complement` and the current number.\n5.  **Store Number:** If the `complement` is not found, we store the current number and its index in the `seen` dictionary.\n6.  **No Pair:** If the loop finishes without finding a pair, we return `None`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n), making it quite efficient.

            { text: "Okay, let's dive into the \"3 Sum\" problem. This one is a bit more complex than \"2 Sum,\" but here's a Python function that solves it efficiently:\n\n```python\ndef three_sum(nums):\n    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to handle duplicates and use two-pointer approach\n    result = []\n    n = len(nums)\n\n    for i in range(n - 2):\n        # Skip duplicate numbers for the first element\n        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:\n            continue\n\n        left, right = i + 1, n - 1  # Initialize two pointers\n\n        while left < right:\n            current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]\n\n            if current_sum == 0:\n                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])\n                # Skip duplicates for the second and third elements\n                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:\n                    left += 1\n                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:\n                    right -= 1\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n            elif current_sum < 0:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right -= 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]\nresult = three_sum(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Sorting:** We start by sorting the input list. This helps in handling duplicates and makes the two-pointer approach possible.\n2.  **Outer Loop:** We iterate through the list with an outer loop, fixing one element at a time.\n3.  **Duplicate Handling (Outer):** We skip duplicate numbers for the first element to avoid duplicate triplets in the result.\n4.  **Two Pointers:** We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the other two numbers that sum up to the negative of the fixed number.\n5.  **Sum Calculation:** We calculate the `current_sum` using the fixed number and the numbers pointed to by `left` and `right`.\n6.  **Target Match:**\n    *   If `current_sum` is 0, we found a triplet. We add it to the `result` list and move the pointers to skip duplicates.\n    *   If `current_sum` is less than 0, we need a larger sum, so we move the `left` pointer to the right.\n    *   If `current_sum` is greater than 0, we need a smaller sum, so we move the `right` pointer to the left.\n7.  **Duplicate Handling (Inner):** We skip duplicates for the second and third elements to avoid duplicate triplets in the result.\n8.  **Return Result:** Finally, we return the list of unique triplets.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is a significant improvement over a naive O(n^3) approach.
